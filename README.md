## Project Description
I analysed the coffee ratings from 32 countries based on certain coffee metrics used for professional evaluation.
The project goal is to conclude which is the best rated coffee.

## Questions & Hypotheses
I have formulated two hypotheses:
- Is the coffee from Ethiopia the best rated?
- Does altitude has an impact in the coffee quality?

## Dataset
I gathered data from the Coffee Quality Institute.

## Workflow
- Gather data
- Data Cleaning
- Visualization
- Conclusions
- Technical Report
